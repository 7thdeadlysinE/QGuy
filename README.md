# QGuy
Main repository for the Q application

3 Main Directories should be available:
  1) QGuyBackend: Handles all backend of the application including but not limited to: Solidity Contract definitions/deployment, Server Side acquisition and rendering...
  2) QGuyFrontEnd: Will be handled in the future as a means of storing app development code making integration between front and backend easier.
  3) AI: The backend development of the AI will be in its own directory since it will be complex and could confuse literacy of the rest of the backend. The AI will eventually be linked to the the app and will require its own server requests from the frontend.  
    Basic Utility: 
          a) Data collection from swiping data.
          b) Development of personal accounts for each user characterizing each of their tastes.
          c) Development of an overarching predictive scheme. Prediction of trend paths, if possible, for populations as a whole (eg: cities, communities, classes).
